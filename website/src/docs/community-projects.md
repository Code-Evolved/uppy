Uppy has a large community of enthusiasts building plugins, integrations with js frameworks, etc! Here's a non-exhaustive list as we just started indexing these.

- [vue-uppy](https://github.com/toast38coza/vue-uppy) — A Vue wrapper for Uppy.io 
- [ng-uppy](https://github.com/sunil-shrestha/ng-uppy) — Sample angular (5.x) app for uppy.io with resumable uploads

We'd like to list more community projects, do you know one that should be on this page? Send us a PR via the link down below.
