Uppy's own [Artur Paikin](https://github.com/arturi) received a [question](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1582#issuecomment-495787004) about creating plugin and wanted to showcase how you could for example, do lossless image optimization before uploading with Uppy. The result might be useful to others too so we're considering adding this to Uppy depending on your feedback.
