Uppy's own [Artur Paikin](https://github.com/arturi) received a [question](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/1582#issuecomment-495787004) about creating plugins and wanted to showcase how you could for example, do lossless image optimization before uploading with Uppy even starts. This could save bandwidth and time, at the tradeoff of not having the original version on the server. We thought the result might be useful to others too so this project is currently under consideration of becoming an official Plugin, depending on your feedback.
